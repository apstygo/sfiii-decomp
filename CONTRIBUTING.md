Before you begin:
- Follow the [build guide](docs/builde-guide.md) to build the project.
- Read through [coding guidelines](docs/coding-guidelines.md).
- Read through [decompilation guide](docs/decompiling.md).

To decide what to decompile you can choose a func from [cri-progress.md](https://github.com/apstygo/sfiii-decomp/blob/main/cri-progress.md). Or choose any other function. All contributions are welcome!
